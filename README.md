# TDDE16 Text Mining

## Lab 1: Information retrieval
In this lab, basic techniques from information retrieval was applied to implement the core of a minimalistic search engine. The data for this lab consists of a collection of app descriptions scraped from the Google Play Store. From this collection, the search engine retrieve those apps whose descriptions best match a given query under the vector space model.

## Lab 2: Text classification
Text classification is the task of sorting text documents into predefined classes. The concrete problem in this lab is the classification of texts with respect to their political affiliation. 

## Lab 3: Text clustering and topic modelling
Text clustering groups documents in such a way that documents within a group are more ‘similar’ to other documents in the cluster than to documents not in the cluster. Worked with both hard and soft clustering techniques; the k-means algorithm, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model.

## Lab 4: Word embeddings
A word embedding is a mapping of words to points in a vector space such that nearby words (points) are similar in terms of their distributional properties. This lab makes use of word vectors that come with state-of-the-art NLP libraries to find similar words, and evaluate their usefulness in a natural language inference task.

## Lab 5: Information extraction
Information extraction (IE) is the task of identifying named entities and semantic relations between these entities in text data. This lab focus on two sub-tasks in IE, named entity recognition (identifying mentions of entities) and entity linking (matching these mentions to entities in a knowledge base).
